### Folder structure
|-- civilian_app    Code of Flutter app for civilians to register problems
|-- rescue_app     Code of Flutter app for rescue members to get problems
|-- sahyog_server   code of FCM push notification with Nodejs

## Future Scopes :
1. Adding pop screen like truecaller with different sound which enables the Rescue team member to get the disaster information without any delay
2. Use Gyroscope sensor for Earthquake, Temperature rise detector for Fire hazards, and many more to report the problem without human interaction with the phone.
3. Will try to implement a system to detect and avoid fake requests
4. The rescue members after indentifying problem can send acknowledge to the user and he/she can track the work
